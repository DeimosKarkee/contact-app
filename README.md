This is a contact app created using Nextjs bootstrapped using create-next-app using Next13.2.4 and experimental app directory. I have used tailwind to create responsive UI. The app uses jsonplaceholder api to fetch data using nextjs native fetch. Individual contacts can also be viewed. The app contains homepage and about page. Search user functionality is also implemented in the homepage.
